      <p>
        I'm a web developer helping make the internet a more functional and friendly place. My background in helicopter maintenance helps me look at the big picture and still pay attention to even the smallest of details  while designing web applications. Working in groups and by myself in remote locations has taught me to be innovative while problem solving whether I am on my own or working with a team. This attention to detail and problem solving has shown in my short time in web development that I will work tenaciously to come up with a solution.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I hope to work on projects that make the world an easier, more functional place to live in with fun and inspiring co-workers.

        <h2>Estimate My App</h2>
        <p>This was my final project while at DevPoint Labs. We were asked to build an application to assist with DevPoint Studios bidding for new projects. My main contribution was developing all of the on click functions of the individual features and updating all of the subtotals and totals. This project is built with a Ruby on Rails back end, and React JS front end.

        <p>A trello style project board that I modeled towards a helicopter work order management system. This project was built with Ruby on Rails using html.erb for the views. Most of the database queries are custom find by SQL queries. This project taught me tons about authentication with Devise and allowing different types of users to do different things as well as a good understanding of Active Record paramaters.

        <p>This project focused on conditional statements to determine who wins in games of Roshambo. It was also my first project modifying the DOM with JavaScript. I probably went overboard with games and rounds, but it gave me more experience by adding a level of complexity to the code. Click 'Check It Out' to go play a few rounds. I have built other versions of this game using jQuery and ReactJS.

You can add items to your cart, remove items, view your cart and total, and checkout; purchasing all the items and resetting the hash to being empty. </p>

        <p>This game is an Oregon Trail style game. You start with some money, some fertilizer and an orange tree. You must fertilize, water, pick oranges, sell oranges, buy fertilizer etc... to keep your tree alive and make money. Be careful not to over water or fertilize your tree or you might kill it. Pick all your oranges before each year passes to avoid losing them. This was a really fun project to work on, and can continually be expanded the more that I learn. </p>

                <p id="farmStory">I grew up in rural North Dakota, 10 miles from the nearest tiny town, about five miles from
                  the Canadian border. Most of my childhood was spent playing outside in the sandbox, building snow forts and
                  riding with Dad in the tractor. Eventually, I would end up driving all the tractors and doing nearly all the
                  work my dad did on the farm. I was never into sports, as my after school activities usually revolved around
                  helping Dad.
                  <br />
                  <br />
            I always remember being around a computer. We started off with DOS, and I was able to learn to navigate that
            pretty early in life. I remember how great Windows 3.1 was when it came out. I built my first computer my
            senior year in high school and was the "IT assistant" during the three free hours I negotiated myself that
            year as well. I've always been quite comfortable using electronic devices.
            <br />
            <br />
            My parents told me I needed to go out and get some education, and then come back and farm if I wanted to do
            that. During a career/college fair I went into the auditorium because it had the comfiest chairs and that
            presentation was about aviation maintenance. It was only a two year college and seemed like it would be fun so
            I decided I would go learn how to fix airplanes. After two years of college I ended up in Utah, and never made
            it back to ND to farm.
