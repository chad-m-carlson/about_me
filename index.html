      <p>Heather entered my life in January of 2012. We immediately hit it off and have been in love ever since. We got
        married in 2015. She loves to travel and has a severe case of FOMO. If you ever need help planning a trip,
        Heather is the one you need to talk too. </p>

      <p>Teagan graced us with her presence early one morning in December. She is our first, and so far, only child and
        the only grand child in the family. Needless to say, she is going to be spoiled for awhile. So far, she most
        enjoys trying to fit her entire first in her mouth.</p>

      <p>Rudy joined our family in 2014. He used to have a wonderful life as a bachelor cat until the dogs showed up. He
        now spends most of his days at the top of his cat tower or running away from Kiwi. Sometimes he craves
        attention, but be warned, he does tend to play rough and not scared to use his teeth or claws (although he has
        yet to draw blood so he seems to know what he is doing).</p>

      <p>Harper joined our family in 2015. She fits the cattle dog descriptions nearly perfectly, she is skittish and
        generally hates people until she gets to know you. After you become familiar she is very loyal and loving. Long
        naps in bed and chasing the laser are her favorite past times.</p>

      <p>Kiwi is our newest pet. We got her as a puppy in 2017. Her unique name originates from when we were traveling
        in New Zealand and decided to get a puppy, we couldn't find any easy to pronounce local, original names so we
        settled on Kiwi. Her favorite past times are chasing Rudy and getting attention from anyone who will give it to
        her.</p>

          <p>My career in helicopter maintenance started in 2006 at a small company based out of the Bountiful SkyPark
            Airport. We performed heavy maintenance on our own and customers helicopters along with work all around the
            intermountain west. I spent most of my summers in Tucson, AZ or Kalispell, MT providing field support on
            Forest Service fire fighting contracts.</p>

          <p>I then switched jobs to work for the largest helicopter operator in the world, Air Methods, where I worked
            with the University of Utah AirMed program. The helicopter I was responsible for wasbased in Tooele, UT. Day
            to day life as an EMS helicopter mechanic was quite boring, and required being on call24 hours a day, 5 days
            a week.</p>

            the same Forest Service contract that I was on in prior years. I was there for 3 years before Teagan was
            born and I decided a career change was due.</p>

      <h2>Google Homepage Re-creation</h2>
      <p>This is an attempt at copying the Google home page using only HTML and CSS. The Google Chrome "inspect element"
        feature was used heavily in this recreation. I learned about using image sprites to grab multiple sections of an
        image to create the logo.</p>

      <h2>Google Results Re-creation</h2>
      <p>The Google search result page recreation was very similar to the home page project. There were more elements to
        work with making the layout of the page tricker. I have already learned much better ways to layout the search
        result page by building this "About Me" page.</p>

      <h2>Rock, Paper, Scissors</h2>
      <p>This project focused on using conditional Javascript statements to decide if the computer or user wins a round
        of rock, paper, scissors. There are also functions to keep the running tally of computer or user wins to
        determine who wins the game based on the number of rounds the user inputs they want to play. The CSS is less
        than desireable on this, but the project initially started as only working in the console.</p>

      <h2>Etch-a-Sketch</h2>
      <p>Event listeners, document query selectors, adding classes, attributes and apending/removing children were used
        heavily in making the Etch-a-Sketch. Like my Rock, Paper, Scissors project, this isn't very responsive and not
        visually appealing, but learning Javascript was the purpose of this exercise.</p>
