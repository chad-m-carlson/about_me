On the first day of class, you will be asked to present a Website.  This website will be used to demonstrate that you can put a website together as well as allow the staff and your peers to get to know a little bit about you.  The site will be built in HTML / CSS (bonus for JavaScript).

The requirements for this site are as follows:

Multiple sections with their own headings.
Consist of multiple pages.
Contain CSS linked from a separate file.
Images in the foreground and background.
BONUS: Build a contact form with fields for name, email, and message (this form does not have to actually work)
BONUS: Use JavaScript on the site.
